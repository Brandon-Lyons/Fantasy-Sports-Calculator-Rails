#Fantasy Sports Calculator

This is Ruby on Rails app for my final capstone project at the [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/). This app is the same as my previous CLI [project](https://github.com/Brandon-Lyons/Fantasy-Sports-Calculator) but it now has an interface and is expanding to include other fantasy sports.

##Features

1. Users can create an account and access their leagues
2. Users cannot access other users' leagues
3. Users can create multiple leagues for each sport
4. Each league can have its rules changed at creation
5. Each league can be edited after creation
6. Each league can be deleted
7. User can calculate the score a player received for all of their leagues by entering the player's name

##Usage

Be aware that this app uses postgresql and Python so a server must be on and Python must be installed.<br />
To run the tests:<br />
`rake`<br />
To start the rails server:<br />
`rails s`
